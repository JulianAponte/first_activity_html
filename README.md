CRUDScope – HTML MediaPanel
</p>

### Description:
This page functions as a CRUD simulation for tasks.

It was created to practice basic HTML tags: such as tables, line breaks, input fields, headings, and paragraphs.

It also covers importing and working with multimedia files.

### Label research

Tags such as the following were used:

- Structure: html, head, body, title, base, meta.
- Semantic: header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer, address, time.
- Non-semantic: div.
- Text: h1–h3, p, strong, em, u, abbr.
- Tables: table, tr, th, td.
- Forms: form, label, input, textarea, button.
- Multimedia: img, audio, video, source.


#### Use cases for labels
 - Structures: This tags, present in all HTML files, constitutes the skeleton of the page.
 - Semantics & non-semantics: Divides the code into sections for efficient operation and faster maintenance.
 - Tables: Used to create a data table in HTML code.
 - multimedia: used for files such as images or videos, to display these files on the page.

#### Semantic & Non-semantic tags
 - Semantic tag: used as a reserved word, tags are created so that HTML can be used in the most common cases.
 - Non-semantic tag: Used in sections that do not use HTML reserved words.

#### Uncommon labels
 - <base> is used to mark a starting point.
 - <abbr> explains acronyms or abbreviations in a clear and accessible way.
 - <time> allows you to write dates in a standardized way, useful for machines and screen readers.
 - Multimedia tags integrate content directly into the page, making it more interactive and professional.
